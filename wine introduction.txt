Wine Quality Analysis
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
The scope of this analysis is to understand relationship of various parameters which impact the quality ratings for both Red and White wine.The data set utilized for the analysis is downloaded from UCI repository https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Wine+Quality and consists of 6000+ sample data for combined Red and White wine types.

Fixed acidity: most acids involved with wine or fixed or nonvolatile (do not evaporate readily)
Volatile acidity: the amount of acetic acid in wine, which at too high of levels can lead to an unpleasant, vinegar taste
Citric acid: found in small quantities, citric acid can add 'freshness' and flavor to wines
Residual sugar: the amount of sugar remaining after fermentation stops, it's rare to find wines with less than 1 gram/liter and wines with greater than 45 grams/liter are considered sweet
Chlorides: the amount of salt in the wine
Free sulfur dioxide: the free form of SO2 exists in equilibrium between molecular SO2 (as a dissolved gas) and bisulfite ion; it prevents microbial growth and the oxidation of wine
Total sulfur dioxide: amount of free and bound forms of S02; in low concentrations, SO2 is mostly undetectable in wine, but at free SO2 concentrations over 50 ppm, SO2 becomes evident in the nose and taste of wine
Density: the density of water is close to that of water depending on the percent alcohol and sugar content
pH: describes how acidic or basic a wine is on a scale from 0 (very acidic) to 14 (very basic); most wines are between 3-4 on the pH scale
Sulphates: a wine additive which can contribute to sulfur dioxide gas (S02) levels, wich acts as an antimicrobial and antioxidant
Alcohol: the percent alcohol content of the wine
Quality: the quality is a rate from 0 to 10 which is given to the wines by assessors, and type denotes whether the wine is red or white.
